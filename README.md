# Resume Code

## Purpose
 [Pybites](https://pybit.es/) has a great newsletter for Python Coaching from Resume guide and Code Improvement Tips. In a recent edition of said newsletter they offered [10 Tips to Make Your Developer Resume Stand Out](https://pybit.es/articles/10-tips-to-make-your-developer-resume-stand-out/). 

 I really enjoyed the post but got me thinking. In interviews, getting a sense of their technical aptitude for actual code can be very difficult. In interviews I have been part of we have used tools like take-home-tests, paper tests, and general discussion to figure out if your skills match the ones listed on your resume. 

 A big opportunity for review is when you have a github or gitlab profile with code you have written. How do you comment, what is your coding style, how do you name your variables, etc. After reading the article I realized having a set of code in my own repo would be a good starting point for any future job search as well as maybe providing a resource for others.

## Commit to Transparency

So it would be very easy to find existing examples of code and claim their perfect features and streamlined code as my own and it may be difficult to tell if the code created is my own or others. So rather than post a "finished" repo, I am going to work on this project just like I would during my day job as a Senior Platform Engineer and commit away warts and all. (I don't squash commits)

I will be using my :brain: and :eyes: along side my usual toolset. I will be using VSCode, GitHub and GitHub Copilot, and other tools I find useful such as the usual suspects, Dev Blogs, Stack Exchange, and Library Docs. 

I want this repo to exist not as a perfect monument of my code, but just to highlight how I work and present myself as an actual developer not a :star2: :star2: :star2: RoCkStAr CoDe GuRu :star2: :star2: :star2:

I do commit that in all cases I will create my own code and code I use from other sources I will do my best to cite especially if it is unique or a sizeable content is used. I maintain that a good developer creates and a great developer steals wherever they can! Or put another way, anyone can copy code but it takes a good developer to copy the right code and implement it correctly.

## Example Code Resume

This is my project so I will pick the code, don't @ me! I will try and pick examples that show my skill set, so don't expect any Java. However I will try and pick items that are interesting and portions would be common in the world I work in.

| Project | Description | Skills Needed |
| :-----: | ----------- | :-----------: |
| **Top Wiki Page by Day - (Simple)** | Create a Python script that, when given a particular Date as a string, retrieve the top viewed page for that day. | Python, Date Manipulation, API, REST |
| **Top Wiki Page by Day - (AWS Lambda)** | Essentially the same as the other demo, however we are going to implement it as an AWS Lambda and include all the pieces that go along with it to build and deploy the Lambda via Terraform through GitHub Actions. | Python, Terraform, AWS Lambda, API, Date Manipulation, Github Actions |
